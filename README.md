IconFont Rater
=========

A simple font based rating [dojo] widget (dijit) using custom [Icomoon] icon fonts.  This widget it keeps it simple.
You simply set the numStars property to set a scale, empty/half/full properties to a character in your your font-set, or use the defaults provided, and then manipulate the value.

A clickable version was added, with just a few lines of code adding more interactivity, showing that nothing need be lost by using iconfont over say standard images.  The same could be done with hover effect if so desired.

##Technology Profile

###Dojo 


>Javascript toolkit built on top of web standards as it's platform. A toolkit for building high quality desktop and mobile web applications.

###Dijit
-------
> An extensive set of widgets (user interface components) and the underlying system to support them. Built fully on-top of the Dojo core.

### Icomoon

##TODO
 - ~~Add way to set value with click~~
 - Build out more interesting custom font
